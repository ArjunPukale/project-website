					<h3>Riverstone Wrist</h3>
					<p>
						There is an elegance in the simplicity of this matte riverstone wrist mala.  Great earthy, woodsy colors to accentuate a natural style.

						Riverstone's energy is said to accelerate change.  It is very useful when performing meditation or therapy- it helps to move more swiftly through the process and focuses on energy to do so.

						Adjustable wrist mala measures approximately 6 inches when closed and 8 1/2 when opened.
