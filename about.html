        <h2>About the store</h2> <p> Tibetan Handicrafts and Bead Store is a family owned business started in 1995 with the purpose of delivering handmade home decors, thanka, sculptures and custom designed jewelries. All our products are environment friendly. We make the products in the shop itself with the help of incredible artisans (mostly women) based on Nepal and Tibet. Our main purpose is to provide beautiful and indigenous decors and jewelries to you with the sole purpose of preserving the heritages and local arts. With your help, we have been able to provide employment opportunities to few people.</p>

        <p>
        All the handicrafts that will be presented as products in the websites are ethically produced, providing fair wages and working conditions for the women of Nepal who generally make them. The 20% of annual budget goes to an child orphanage called Support Childrens of Nepal. Hence, this website will develop a cause about empowering womens and childrens of Nepal.</p>
